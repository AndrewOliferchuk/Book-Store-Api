## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Java 11 or higher
- Maven
- MySQL


### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   `bash git clone https://github.com/AndrewOliferchuk/Book-Store-Api`

2. Navigate to the project directory:`bash cd Book-Store-Api`

3. Create a MySQL database:`sql
   CREATE DATABASE name`, (instead of `name` you can put your database name);

4. Update the `env.template` file with your MySQL database credentials, also
   you can use `resources/application.properties` for your MySQL database credentials;

5. Build the project using Maven:
   `bash
   mvn clean package
   `

6. Run the application:
   `bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   `


### Docker Initialization Issue

When setting up Docker, I encountered an issue where executing docker-compose up resulted in my project endlessly attempting to start. 
The root cause was that MySQL took longer to initialize compared to the application. 
This led to numerous errors because the application tried to connect to the database before it was ready.

### Solution
To avoid this problem during the first build, itâ€™s advisable to start the database first and then launch the application. 
Additionally, it's essential to verify that Liquibase is functioning correctly. 
Issues like mismatched column types and other discrepancies can cause database formation problems.
